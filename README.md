# Python-projects
Small but perfectly formed

I'm investing some of my time and brain power into the technical side of AI and in particular and interested in developing know-how around the use of Python in machine learning via Azure Machine Learning.

What appears here starts with a small program I created while doing the Python for Everyone course via U. of Michigan and delivered via Futurelearn in the UK. Chuck Severance is a great teacher and with his confidence and some rudimentary experience in code, I completed his six week course in three days.

Shouldn't be but I'm still quite proud of that.

Will keep udating this and hopefully engaging with others looking to lift their Python from humble beginnings.
