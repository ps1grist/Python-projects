# Python-projects
Small but perfectly formed

I'm investing some of my time and brain power into the technical side of AI and in particular and interested in developing my knowledge of Python, Azure ML, Tensorflow, Jupyter and others.

Not sure how often I'll update this but I hope it becomes a useful repository, over time.
